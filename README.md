# Update Portfolio

This project is an update version of the 'Responsive Portfolio using Bootstrap' project.

## Project Notes

Some enhancement were done in this project particularly the use of Bootstrap 5 to re-design the pages.

Background image and google fonts were also added to improve the typography of the pages.

In the Portfolio page, two of the homework assignments and project 1 were highlighted. 

If you hover to the image corresponding to the homework or project, a description text will be displayed as shown below:
